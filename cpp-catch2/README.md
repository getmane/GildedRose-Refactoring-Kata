C++ version of Gilded Rose with Catch 2 and Approvals
======================================================

This is a C++ start of the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata. See
the [top level readme](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)
 for a general description of the exercise.

There are two (failing) unit tests included here. One uses only the catch2 framework, the other additionally uses [ApprovalTests](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.cpp). You should choose one of these tests to work with and delete the other.

CMake
-----

CMake is included in CLion from JetBrains. Without CMake files
CLion has a hard time to handle c-projects.

To install CMake (if you don't use CLion) on macOS using brew

    brew install cmake

Tested on CMake 3.15.3 (included with CLion 2019.3) on 	macOS
