# Gilded Rose starting position in Gleam

I assume you have [installed](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/) `gleam` on your system.

## Run unit tests from the command line

```sh
$ gleam test
```

## Get the TextTest fixture on the command line

Execute it on the command line with an argument for the number of days:

```sh
$ gleam run -- --days=30
```

Compare the output to [stdout.gr](../texttests/ThirtyDays/stdout.gr) for validation.
There are instructions in the [TextTest Readme](../texttests/README.md) for setting up TextTest.
